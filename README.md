# General Functions

A toolkit of useful functions and extensions.

## Introduction

This project was created to practice unit testing and test driven development (TDD).
The extensions are code I have used over the years in different projects so thought it was about time to put them all in one library.
They have been updated to use the latest features of .NET and C#.

## Getting Started

You will need a copy of Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Core 3.1 installed.
The project was created with VS 2019 version 16.4.3
